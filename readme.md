Uxn32 - Uxn Emulator for Windows and Wine
=========================================

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/randrew/uxn32/uxn32-banner.png)

Uxn32 is a graphical emulator for the [Uxn](https://100r.co/site/uxn.html) virtual machine.

| Uxn32.exe plus a collection of pre-built ROMs ready to play. |

Features
--------

* Compatible with: Windows NT4, Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows 10, Windows 11, and Wine. Works on both 32-bit and 64-bit systems.
* Specifically built to also work with Wine on Linux and other OSs.
* Small and simple - single .exe, no installer, no dependencies.
* Sandboxed file system access for Uxn program ROMs.
* Debugger with stepping, disassembly viewing and editing, memory view, and stack viewing and editing.
* Uxn programs receive events at full speed and repaint immediately. Got a 240hz display? Now your Uxn drawing program can make use of it.
* Pre-emptive execution, so it won't freeze up if the Uxn program goes into an infinite loop, unlike the SDL2 version.
* Compiles with: Visual C++ 6.0 (VC6 1998) and later, Clang, clang-cl, GCC via Winelib, MinGW Clang, and MinGW GCC.

Building
--------

### Windows

For VC6 and other old Microsoft IDEs and compilers, just open uxn32.dsp and hit build.

For later Visual Studio versions and MinGW, there is a CMakeLists.txt file to use with CMake. It's been tested to work with multiple different combinations of IDEs and toolchains, such as: CLion + MSVC, CLion + MinGW Clang, Qt Creator + MSVC, Qt Creator + MinGW Clang, Visual Studio Code with C/C++ extensions, standalone with Ninja or NMake and MSVC, and more.

VC6 is the easiest way to produce a `.exe` that works with old Windows versions and which doesn't require bundling `.dll` files or statically linking to large C runtimes.

### Linux & Other UNIX

The easiest way to develop Uxn32 from within Linux is to use Winelib. This lets you use regular GCC or clang, and doesn't require installing MinGW. The output `.exe` will be `ELF` (Linux format) instead of `PE` (Windows format) so you can't copy it to a Windows system, but it will work great with Wine on Linux.

Make sure you have Wine installed, and also either gcc or clang installed, then do something like:

```sh
wrc -I. -fouxn32.res uxn32.rc
winegcc -mwindows -mno-cygwin -m32 -Os -s -I. -o uxn32_elf.exe.so `find -name *.c` uxn32.res \
    -luser32 -lgdi32 -lshell32 -lshlwapi -lcomdlg32 -lcomctl32 -lwinmm
mv uxn32_elf.exe.so uxn32_elf.exe
```

Then run it with `wine uxn32_elf.exe`. If you want to make a debug build, replace the `-Os -s` with `-O0 -g`. You can use gdb to debug it with `winedbg uxn32_elf.exe`.

<small>(Actually, if you use clang as your compiler with `winegcc`, and you have `lld` installed, you can add `-b i386-pc-windows-msvc -Wl,/safeseh:no` and then it *will* output a `PE` executable that will run on Windows. But it will probably only run on Windows 7 and later.)</small>

If you want to use MinGW on a Linux host to produce an executable for Windows, you can do a similar invocation by hand, or try using CMake.

### Other

Building with some other system or by hand is easy. There's only one resource file, `uxn32.rc`, and two source files, `uxn32.c` and `core32.c`. You don't need any special compiler flags or preprocessor definitions. But you will need to link these libraries: `user32.lib gdi32.lib shell32.lib shlwapi.lib comdlg32.lib comctl32.lib winmm.lib`

Uxn32 TODO
----------

- [x] ~~Add drag'n'drop ROM loading.~~
- [x] ~~Add pixel doubling/scaling.~~
- [x] ~~Audio output.~~
- [ ] Volume control.
- [x] ~~Add console output.~~
- [x] ~~Add console input.~~
- [x] ~~Add File, View, etc. menus.~~
- [ ] Add toggle to show/hide menu bar.
- [ ] Add preferences.
- [x] ~~Add a graphical debugger.~~
- [x] ~~Add "About" dialog box. (Currently sitting unused in the resources file.)~~
- [ ] Add a preference to set filesystem sandbox directory, and to restrict read and write operations. (Filesystem sandboxing is currently based on the current working directory.)
- [ ] Fix mixing of too many synonmous types (DWORD, ULONG, Uint32, etc.) in places where just 1 would do.
- [ ] Fix missing and inconsistent 'static' on functions.
- [x] ~~Fix not redrawing the empty area around the Uxn virtual screen in the window client area when dirtied due to external reasons (like dragging a window over it in a non-composited Windows desktop.)~~
- [ ] Use a better timing and display sync method. (Might require special casing for composited Windows desktops.)
- [x] ~~Test and fix C89 issues with GCC in MinGW, if any. (Tested and works in VC6, MSVC 2019, clang-cl, MinGW-w64 Clang, but not yet tested in GCC.)~~
- [ ] Reorganize some Device stuff.
- [ ] Add a resource usage and performance indicator panel. (See how much % Uxn virtual CPU time is being used, time spent on file access, etc.)
